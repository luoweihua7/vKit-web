For those Macs with a T2 security chip, you need to enable the option to allow external booting. This can be done from the Startup Security Utility:

Boot your Mac while holding down the Command + R key to enter Recovery mode.

Select the Startup Security Utility from the Utilities menu.

Select the option to Allow booting from external media.

You should then be able to boot from the USB flash drive you created to install macOS Catalina.
